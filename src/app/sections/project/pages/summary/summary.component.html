        Onework is a project made and deployed by <a href="/users">{{ names[0] }}</a> and <a href="/users">{{ names[1] }}</a>, in order to add precision and agility to their hiring process work and that of their friends. Nonprofit.

        The app is in the first sprint of development. Soon we are going to improve UX UI, depuration, language translations and websockets service for live drag and drop in <a href="/board">the board</a> and more ambitiously our own videocall service with standard WebRTC.

        Thanks to the dev tools, which are activated from the right menu, you will be able to see the local status of the front-end application printed on the console.

        The server is programmed to save energy by automatically turning itself off at night.
