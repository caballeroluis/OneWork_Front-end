        The app is in the first sprint of development. Soon we are going to improve UX UI and websockets service on <a href="/board">the board</a> and our own videoconferencing service.

        Thanks to the dev tools, which are activated from the right menu, you will be able to see the local status of the front-end application printed on the console.
